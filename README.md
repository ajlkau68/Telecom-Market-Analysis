## Recommendations

1. **Target Low-Performing Cities:**  
   Focus marketing efforts on cities like **Chandigarh** and **Patna**, which have lower market share and revenue. Localized campaigns could drive adoption in these areas.

2. **Post-5G Revenue Recovery:**  
   Address the post-5G revenue dip by **introducing premium plans** and offering **discounts** or **promotions** to increase 5G adoption.

3. **Expand in High-Revenue Cities:**  
   In cities like **Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata**, continue pushing high-revenue-generating plans and possibly introduce upgraded versions for premium users.

4. **Monitor Competitor Activity:**  
   Keep a close watch on **PIO** and **Britel**, Atliqoâ€™s top competitors, to identify areas for competitive advantage, particularly in cities where Atliqo is underperforming.

5. **Introduce Loyalty Programs:**  
   Given the improvement in the **churn rate post-5G**, introduce loyalty rewards and retention strategies to keep customers engaged and subscribed to higher-value plans.

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics:** Use machine learning models to forecast future trends based on current data.
- **Competitor Deep Dive:** Add a competitive analysis section that looks more in-depth at the performance of key competitors.
